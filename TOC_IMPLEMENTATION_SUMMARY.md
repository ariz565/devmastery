- ✅ **State Management**: React state handling for TOC creation and editing
- ✅ **Interactive Features**: Add, view, edit, delete TOC items
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Level-based styling and indentation
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Required fields, slug generation, difficulty levels

### 5. Code Quality & Performance

- ✅ **Syntax Errors Fixed**: All compilation errors resolved
- ✅ **TypeScript Types**: Proper interfaces for all TOC-related data
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- ✅ **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and async handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Structure

```sql
TableOfContents {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  title: String
  slug: String (Unique)
  description: String
  order: Int
  level: Int (1-3 hierarchy levels)
  parentId: String (Self-referential FK)
  contentType: Enum (blog, note, leetcode, section)
  estimatedReadTime: Int
  difficulty: Enum (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  isPublished: Boolean
  topicId: String (FK to Topic)
  relatedBlogId: String (Optional FK to Blog)
  relatedNoteId: String (Optional FK to Note)
  relatedLeetcodeProblemId: String (Optional FK to LeetcodeProblem)
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/admin/topics/[id]/table-of-contents` - Retrieve all TOC items for a topic
- `POST /api/admin/topics/[id]/table-of-contents` - Create new TOC item
- `PUT /api/admin/topics/[id]/table-of-contents` - Update existing TOC item
- `DELETE /api/admin/topics/[id]/table-of-contents` - Delete TOC item

### Frontend Features

- **Hierarchical Display**: Visual representation of 3-level content structure
- **Content Type Icons**: Visual indicators for blogs, notes, code problems, sections
- **Difficulty Badges**: Color-coded difficulty levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- **Publishing Status**: Draft/published states with visual indicators
- **Estimated Read Time**: Time estimates for content planning
- **Interactive Modals**: Professional UI for creating and editing TOC items
